Conclusion
The possibility of working with fresh IoT data is one of the most interesting fields in analytics.
This includes the possibility of having near-realtime insights on data.
Nowadays, cloud providers have fully integrated and secure ecosystems to work, but the number of solutions and the cost must be well calculated in function of the business needs.
We opted for a fairly simple architecture, that provides a solid basis for developers to build a front-end application and allows a quick time-to-market.
On the data science side, Azure Databricks and Power BI turned to be a powerful combination to quickly extract insights from data and even make recommendations on it.
The data that we got had some gaps, but it was interesting to foresee a lot of applications.
As we expected to get fresher data, it will become possible to apply other algorithms, such as:
-time series algorithms on shorter periods of time
-better collaborative filtering
-more meaningful clustering analysis
