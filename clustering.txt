Our approach towards Clustering
We used the K-Means model, which is computationally quite simple and generates satisfactory results

We obtained models for several 2D approaches:
-Customer sales
--Special beers sales by volume | Number of special beers sold
--Number of special beer sold in proportion of the total | Volume of special beers sold in proportion of the total
-Sales representatives
--Special beers sales by volume | Number of special beers sold
--Number of special beer sold in proportion of the total | Volume of special beers sold in proportion of the total
-Customer geolocation
--Number of customers in 1km /10 km radius | Volume of special beers sold

To obtain the best number of clusters, we tested the information cost for several k-means on smaller samples
To further explore insights about obtained clusters, we put the data in hive tables for each concern of the clustering analysis
